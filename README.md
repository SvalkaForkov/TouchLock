An iOS Messages Extension that I wrote for fun to securely send information like photos, videos, and text.

While iOS Messages does support sending messages in invisible ink, anyone else browsing the phone/those messages can see those messages.

This app will securely store the message so that only the phone owner (verified via TouchID) can see the message right in the Messages app.

The benefit to this is when sharing/receiving information with friends and family that you might want to look back on (i.e.: credit cards, Social Security numbers, private photos, etc.)
